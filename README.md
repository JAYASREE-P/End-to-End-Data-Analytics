End-to-End Data Analytics Project

Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline using Python and SQL.
It covers data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
The goal is to showcase how raw data can be processed to generate meaningful insights.

Key Features
Data Extraction: Using SQL to query data from a relational database.
Data Transformation & Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data with Python (Pandas).
Data Analysis: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Data Visualization: Creating insightful charts and graphs to interpret key metrics.
SQL Integration: Use of SQL for querying and managing the database for reporting purposes.
Automation: Automating parts of the pipeline for future scalability.

Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data processing and visualization.
SQL: Used for querying and managing relational databases.
Jupyter Notebooks: For exploratory data analysis and visualization.
Database: Any SQL-based database system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

Prerequisites
Install Python 3.x and a SQL-based database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
Clone the repository.
Install the necessary Python libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
